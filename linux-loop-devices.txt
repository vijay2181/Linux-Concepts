Loop Devices:
==============



1 WHAT IS A LOOP DEVICE?
- loop device is a block device that maps its data blocks not to a physical device such as a hard disk or optical disk drive, but to the blocks of a regular file in a filesystem or to another block device. 
- loop device is a virtual or pseudo-device which enables a regular file to be accessed as a block device.
- A loop device is a pseudo device that acts as a block-based device.
- loop device is a regular file or device that is mounted as a file system
- loop device is a device driver that allows you to mount a file that acts as a block device
- loop devices enable binding a regular file to a special block device, thereby creating a virtual file system.
- loop devices essentially allow you to mount regular files as file systems,
- loop device is a device driver that allows you to mount a file that acts as a block device (a loop device is not actually a device type, it's an ordinary file).
- loop device makes a file appear as its own block device.
- loop device is a file that have been mounted as device

- loop device in Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux or BSD, is a pseudo-device that allows a computer file to be accessed as if it were a block device. Essentially, the operating system kernel treats the contents of the file as if they were blocks on a device. This concept is particularly useful for scenarios like mounting ISO images or working with virtual file systems.



2 WHAT REALLY IS A LOOP DEVICE?
- a loop device is the operating system treating a file, as if it were a block device
- loop device is a psuedo-device that makes a computer file as a block device, this block device maps it's data blocks not to a physical device such as a hard disk or optical disk drive but to the blocks of a regular file in the linux file system. 
- a loop device maps a normal file onto a virtual block device, this allows for the file to be used as a virtual file system, inside another file, with linux it is possible to make another file system inside a single file.

create your own loop device:
----------------------------
this loop device is useful whenever i dont have any physical disks available or i needed any extra hard drive 

losetup -f   --> finds the first unused loop device on system
/dev/loop10

mkdir /test
touch /test/file1
fallocate -l 5G /test/file1   ---> allocating 5GB to a file, since we cannot mount an empty file
ll -hl /test/file1

- create a link between lookback device and raw file
losetup /dev/loop10 /test/file1

lsblk
loop10 -> 5G 

losetup -a

- now i can use this device as a normal partition or make a lvm partition or go with different storage options 
- next we need to assign a file system to this loop device and mount it(temporary and permanent)

mkfs.xfs /dev/loop10

mkdir /yahoo
mount /dev/loop10 /yahoo/

cd /yahoo
touch file{1..10}.txt
ls

df -hT /yahoo/
-> /dev/loop10 -> mounted on /yahoo

- but this is a temporary mount, we need to make it permananet
cat > /etc/fastab
/test/file1         /yahoo       xfs     defaults   0 0

- here, in above, we np need to use uuid, cause the file is not like a /dev/sda like block device that could probe in different order, it wont move, so it is not a problem if you using the absoulte path

mount -a   --> permanent mount, so that mount point wont last when server reboots

ls /yahoo/  --> some content is there

- so this is how we can make partition inside loopback device 




Remove Link:
------------
- suppose if you want to remove link b/w the loopback device and the raw file, then follow below steps

unmount /yahoo
- remove the entry from /etc/fstab
/test/file1         /yahoo       xfs     defaults   0 0

- next free the loopback device
losetup -d /dev/loop10
ls /yahoo/    ---> no content
