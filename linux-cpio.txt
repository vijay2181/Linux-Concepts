---
  ls | cpio  -ov archive.cpio   ---> archive 

  cpio -iv < test.cpio  -> 

  find / -print -depth | cpio  -ov > slash.cpio
  find . -depth | cpio  -ov > slash.cpio


  cpio -it -F archive.cpio   --> shows all files present in an archive

  find . -iname "*.txt" | cpio -ov -H tar > textfiles.tar  --> copies all text files in cwd into tar format file

  find . -iname "*.txt" | cpio -ov -H tar -F vijay:/dev/rst0 --rsh-command=usr/bin/ssh --> it will findout .txt files in cwd and formats and creates an archive with cpio, and the same file vijay im going to write into tape drive
